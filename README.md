# Social Hacking final assignemnt:#
## Create a system that amplifies a physical gesture (face, body, etc.), and document yourself or someone else using it. ##

For this assignment I created a mouth and two ears (left and right) amplifiers.

It is written in openFrameworks, based on the face tracking/detection example.

It is intended as an experiment of amplification of specific organs as an (anti)metaphor for their most commonly perceived functions in a chat context.
